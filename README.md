Data structures in js:Data structures is a way of collectiing and organising data in such a way that we can perorm operations on these data in an efective way.For example, we have a data which has student name "Harprit" and his age is 19.Over here the "Harprit is a string data typpe and 19 is an integer of the data type. 
Types of Data types are:
1)Stack 
Stack is used to handle events and it is similar to queue,they are the last the last item in,the first item out (LIFO).The last item added into the stack will be the first one taken out of the stack,its just a basic arrays where only thing you can do,more or less,is to push and pop.To build a stack we need a storage variable that holds whatever it is that we trying to put into our stack.

Real life example: whenever you are browsing and want to go on last page and forward page.

2)Queues
The queue is similar to stack but the key difference is first-in, first-out (FIFO).So the two big actions are enqueue and dequeue. We add to the back and remove from the front.
 
3)Hash tables



2)Linked list 
A linked list is mostly used for languages that do not have dynamic sizing arrays. Linked lists organize items sequentially, with each item pointing to the next item.
Real life example of linked list is the train .Each of the coach is connect to its previous next coach(Except first and last).Our brain is also a good example of linked list.
Advantages of linked list:
a)Linked list is dynamic data strucutre.
b)inked List can grow and shrink during run time.
c)Insertion and Deletion Operations are Easier.
d)Efficient Memory Utilization ,i.e no need to pre-allocate memory.
e)Faster Access time,can be expanded in constant time without memory overhead.
Disadvantage of linked list :
a)They use more memory than arrays because of the storage used by their pointers.
b)Difficulties arise in linked lists when it comes to reverse traversing.
c)Nodes in a linked list must be read in order from the beginning as linked lists are inherently sequential access.


3)JavaScript Recursion:
